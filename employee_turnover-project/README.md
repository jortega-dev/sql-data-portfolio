## Key Findings

Night shift concentration of high-risk employees (fatigue, schedule strain).

Low training + no clear promotion path strongly overlaps with high risk.

Zero recognition and zero bonus correlates with low satisfaction + high risk.

High overtime appears with higher risk (burnout).

## Practical Solutions

Night shift retention plan: shift differential pay, predictable schedules, rotate weekends, extra break policy.

Training ramp for new hires (first 90 days): structured onboarding + skill checkpoints (reduce early exits).

Promotion path clarity: define requirements for Level 1 → Level 2 → Lead; publish timeline + skills matrix.

Recognition system: monthly recognition tied to safety/quality output; supervisors required to log recognitions.

Overtime control: cap overtime; cross-train to reduce reliance on a few employees.

Bonus fairness: transparent rules (attendance + quality + training completion), paid quarterly.
