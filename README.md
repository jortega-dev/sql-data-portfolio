# SQL Portfolio – Jose Ortega

## About Me
Hi, I’m Jose Ortega. I’m building my skills in SQL, Data Engineering, and Cloud technologies.  
This repository contains practice projects I’ve completed while learning SQL, including filtering, joins, and aggregations.  
My goal is to develop a strong portfolio for data-focused roles, including positions at Walmart and other companies.

## Projects
- `basic_select_practice1.sql` – Basic SELECT statements with WHERE, AND, OR  
- `employee_select_practice.sql` – Employee filtering practice
